# iOS Calculator
Yes, it's right, iPad does not have a native calculator. And navigating through the App Store looking for a good
one and completely free (Ads and in app purchase) you will figure out that there is none.
And that's why I'm creating a new one, trying to stay as close as possible to the iPhone calculator design and functionalities.

# Configuration
Inside iOS-Calculator cloned repository type `pod install`, it will install some dependencies.

# Running
Open `Calculator.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and press `âŒ˜ + R`
